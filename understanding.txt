Overview
The Document Processor Application allows users to upload PDF documents, which are then processed to extract text content. The extracted content is chunked into smaller segments, embeddings are generated using a specified language model, and stored for efficient searching.

Module Structure
The primary module for this application is document_processor.py. This module contains the core functionality for document handling, text extraction, chunking, and embedding generation.

DocumentProcessor Class
The DocumentProcessor class is the main component of the application that orchestrates the processing steps for uploaded documents.

Initialization
Copy Code
class DocumentProcessor:
    def __init__(self, target_folder: str):
        self.target_folder = target_folder
        self.documents = []
In the __init__ method:

target_folder specifies the directory where processed documents will be stored.
documents is a list to hold the extracted content from PDF files.
Load and Embed Documents
Copy Code
def load_and_embed_documents(self, uploaded_files: List[io.BytesIO]):
    for file in uploaded_files:
        text = self.extract_text(file)
        chunks = self.chunk_text(text)
        embeddings = self.generate_embeddings(chunks)
        self.documents.extend(embeddings)
In this method:

It iterates over a list of uploaded PDF files.
For each file, it extracts the text, chunks it, generates embeddings, and appends them to the documents list.
Document Processing
Extract Text
Copy Code
def extract_text(self, pdf_file: io.BytesIO) -> str:
    # [Implementation code to extract text from PDF]
This method takes a PDF file as input and extracts the text using a suitable library (e.g., PyPDF2, pdfminer).
Chunking
Copy Code
def chunk_text(self, text: str) -> List[str]:
    # [Implementation code to split text into chunks]
This method splits the extracted text into smaller, manageable chunks to ensure better embedding generation and searching efficiency.
Embedding Generation
Copy Code
def generate_embeddings(self, chunks: List[str]) -> List[EmbeddingObject]:
    # [Implementation code to generate embeddings]
This method generates embeddings for each text chunk using a specified language model, such as one provided by OpenAI or another library. The embeddings enable semantic searching through the content.
Example Usage
Hereâ€™s a simplified usage example of the DocumentProcessor class:

Copy Code
import os
import io
from typing import List
from document_processor import DocumentProcessor

# Initialize the DocumentProcessor
processor = DocumentProcessor(target_folder="./docs/")

# Example of processing uploaded PDF files
uploaded_files = [...]  # List of io.BytesIO objects containing PDF file contents
processor.load_and_embed_documents(uploaded_files)

# Get uploaded documents
documents = processor.get_uploaded_documents()
print(documents)
Explanation
The example imports necessary libraries and initializes an instance of the DocumentProcessor.
It demonstrates the process of loading and embedding documents from a list of uploaded.
Finally, it retrieves the processed documents for further use or searching.
Conclusion
This document summarizes the key functionalities of the Document Processor Application's code. The application effectively handles PDF uploads, text extraction, chunking, and embedding generation, making it a valuable tool for document search and retrieval tasks.
